## Exercises 5-1 & 5-2
Introducing pointers! Pointers have long been my stumbling block in learning C, but I think I'm approaching the topic with sufficient momentum and understanding to break through. These first exercises use pointers to permit functions to alter variables in the calling function. I can already imagine how this could've saved me some flail on the polish calculator; this offers a way for functions to communicate beyond their return value, and without having to maintain global state variables. The type of a pointer specifies the 'amount of memory' it points to - the pointer itself holds an address, but when should a program stop reading? This is specified by the type of the pointer; a char should read 1 byte, while an int should read 4, all depending, of course, on your architecture's implementation. So far, so good.
